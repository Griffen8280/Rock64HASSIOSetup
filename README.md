# Rock64 I2C LCD
Setup an I2C LCD screen on a Rock64 running dietpi OS

This project came out of repurposing a Iconikal Rockchip SBC Recon Sentinel which includes the following:
1. Rock64 SBC (1G of RAM)
2. 16X4 LCD screen with I2C driver module
3. 16Gb MicroSD card
4. 5V 3A 1.35mm Power Adapter

This board will be running pi-hole on my network which can be installed by following their tutorials here:  
https://pi-hole.net

The modules and scripts included here are to setup the LCD screen to output the running status of the pi-hole application and the IP address of the device.
